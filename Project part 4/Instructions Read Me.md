Project: Consider the following data (Shirts.txt in Moodle), which describes the strength of  a shirt  (which makes it harder to tear).  64 specimens were taken and the country of manufacture,  the material, the quality of material, and the amount of a special dye which is supposed to prevent tearing.

We wish to write a  program with many options, namely:
a.	Test a linear relationship between Strength of the shirt, and quality of material. Plot the relationship and determine if it is significant.
b.	Test a quadratic relationship between Strength of the shirt, and quality of material. Plot the relationship and determine if it is significant.
c.	Test a linear relationship between Strength of the shirt, and quality of material and amount of die.
d.	We wish to examine country of origin. Display relative frequency as a pie chart, 3D pie chart, and as a bar graph.
e.	Concerning the strength, we wish to determine basic measures, such as:
Mean, sample standard deviation, population standard deviation, median, Inter quartile range, 25, 50, 75, and 90th percentiles, range, and mode.
f.	For the strength variable, prepare a histogram, and determine the midpoint of the class with the greatest frequency.  
g.	For the strength variable, prepare a boxplot and stem and leaf plot. 
h.	For the mean of the strength variable, find a 98% confidence interval.
i.	For the origin, find a 98% confidence interval for the probability that  a randomly chosen shirt was manufacture in India.
j.	Is there a difference in the expected strength of shirts from different countries?  Which pairs are significantly different from each other?
k.	Is there a difference in the expected strength of shirts from different countries and different materials?  
l.	Is there any interaction between different countries and different materials?  
m.	What are the means for each country?
n.	What are the means for each material?
o.	What are the means for each country together with each material?
